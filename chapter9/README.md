# 9. Error Handling

Most languages don't distinguish between *recoverable* and *unrecoverrable* errors and handle both in the same way, using mechanisms such as exceptions. Rust doesn't have exceptions. Instead, it has the type `Result<T, E>` for recoverable errors and the `panic!` macro that stops execution when the program encounters an unrecverable error.


## 9.1 Unrecoverrable Errors with `panic!`

There are two ways to cause a panic in practice:
1. by taking an action that causes our code to panic (such as accessing an array past the end)
2. explicitly calling the `panic!` macro

By default, these panics will print a failure message, unwind, clean up the stack, and quit. Via an environment variable, you can also have Rust display the call stack when a panic occurs to make it easier to track down the source of the panic.

### Unwinding the Stack or Aborting in Response to a Panic

By default, when a panic occurs, the program starts *Unwinding*, which means Rust walks back up the stack and cleans up the data from each function it encounters. However, walking back and cleaning up is a lot of work. Rust therefore allows you to choose the alternative of immediately aborting, which ends the program without cleaning up.

Memory that the program was using will then need to be cleaned up by the operating system. If in your project you need to make the resultant binary as small as possiblem you can switch from unwinding to aborting upon a panic by adding `panic = 'abort'` to the appropriate `[profile]` sections in your *Cargo.toml* file. For example, if you want to abort on panic in release mode, add this:
```toml
[profile.release]
panic = 'abort'
```

```rust
fn main() {
    panic!("crash and burn");
}
```

```shell
$ cargo run
   Compiling panic v0.1.0 (file:///projects/panic)
    Finished `dev` profile [unoptimized + debuginfo] target(s) in 0.25s
     Running `target/debug/panic`

thread 'main' panicked at src/main.rs:2:5:
crash and burn
note: run with `RUST_BACKTRACE=1` environment variable to display a backtrace
```


An example when a `panic!` call comes from a library because of a bug in our code instead of from our code calling the macro directly:
```rust
fn main() {
    let v = vec![1, 2, 3];

    v[99];
}
```

```shell
$ cargo run
   Compiling panic v0.1.0 (file:///projects/panic)
    Finished `dev` profile [unoptimized + debuginfo] target(s) in 0.27s
     Running `target/debug/panic`

thread 'main' panicked at src/main.rs:4:6:
index out of bounds: the len is 3 but the index is 99
note: run with `RUST_BACKTRACE=1` environment variable to display a backtrace
```

In C, attempting to read beyond the end of a data structure is undefined behavior. You might get whatever is at the location in memory that would correspond to that element in the data structure, even though the memory doesn’t belong to that structure. This is called a *buffer overread* and can lead to security vulnerabilities if an attacker is able to manipulate the index in such a way as to read data they shouldn’t be allowed to that is stored after the data structure. To protect your program from this sort of vulnerability, if you try to read an element at an index that doesn’t exist, Rust will stop execution and refuse to continue.


The `note:` line tells us that we can set the `RUST_BACKTRACE` environment variable to get a backtrace of exactly what happened to cause the error. A backtrace is a list of all the functions that have been called to get to this point. Backtraces in Rust work as they do in other languages: The key to reading the backtrace is to start from the top and read until you see files you wrote. That’s the spot where the problem originated. The lines above that spot are code that your code has called; the lines below are code that called your code. These before-and-after lines might include core Rust code, standard library code, or crates that you’re using. 


```shell
$ RUST_BACKTRACE=1 cargo run
thread 'main' panicked at src/main.rs:4:6:

```

The exact output you see might be different depending on your operating system and Rust version. In order to get backtraces with this information, debug symbols must be enabled. Debug symbols are enabled by default when using `cargo build` or `cargo run` without the `--release` flag, as we have here.

## 9.2 Recoverable Errors with `Result`

Most errors aren’t serious enough to require the program to stop entirely. Sometimes when a function fails, it’s for a reason that you can easily interpret and respond to. For example, if you try to open a file and that operation fails because the file doesn’t exist, you might want to create the file instead of terminating the process.

The `Result` enum is defined as having two variants: `Ok` and `Err`:

```rust
enum Result<T, E> {
    Ok(T),
    Err(E),
}
```

The `T` and `E` are generic type parameters. `T` represents the type of the value that will be returned in a success case within the `Ok` variant, and `E` represents the type of the error that will be returned in a failure case within the `Err` variant. Because `Result` has these generic type parameters, we can use the `Result` type and the functions defined on it in many different situations where the success value and error value we want to return may differ.

```rust
use std::fs::File;

fn main() {
    let greeting_file_result = File::open("hello.txt");
}
```

The return type of `File::open` is a `Result<T, E>`. The generic parameter `T` has been filled in by the implementation of `File::open` with the type of the success value, `std::fs::File`, which is a file handle. The type of `E` used in the error value is `std::io::Error`. This return type means the call to `File::open` might succeed and return a file handle that we can read from or write to. The function call also might fail: For example, the file might not exist, or we might not have permission to access the file. The `File::open` function needs to have a way to tell us whether it succeeded or failed and at the same time give us either the file handle or error information. This information is exactly what the `Result` enum conveys.

```rust
use std::fs::File;

fn main() {
    let greeting_file_result = File::open("hello.txt");

    let greeting_file = match greeting_file_result {
        Ok(file) => file,
        Err(error) => panic!("Problem opening the file: {error:?}"),
    };
}
```

Note that, like the `Option` enum, the `Result` enum and its variants have been brought into scope by the prelude, so we don’t need to specify `Result::` before the `Ok` and `Err` variants in the `match` arms.


If there's no file named *hello.txt* in our current directory and we run this code, we'll see the following output from the `panic!` macro:

```shell
$ cargo run
   Compiling error-handling v0.1.0 (file:///projects/error-handling)
    Finished `dev` profile [unoptimized + debuginfo] target(s) in 0.73s
     Running `target/debug/error-handling`

thread 'main' panicked at src/main.rs:8:23:
Problem opening the file: Os { code: 2, kind: NotFound, message: "No such file or directory" }
note: run with `RUST_BACKTRACE=1` environment variable to display a backtrace
```

### Matching on Different Errors

```rust
use std::fs::File;
use std::io::ErrorKind;

fn main() {
    let greeting_file_result = File::open("hello.txt");

    let greeting_file = match greeting_file_result {
        Ok(file) => file,
        Err(error) => match error.kind() {
            ErrorKind::NotFound => match File::create("hello.txt") {
                Ok(fc) => fc,
                Err(e) => panic!("Problem creating the file: {e:?}"),
            },
            _ => {
                panic!("Problem opening the file: {error:?}");
            }
        },
    };
}
```

#### Alternatives to Using `match` with `Result<T, E>`

Another way to write the same logic using closures and the `unwrap_or_else` method:

```rust
use std::fs::File;
use std::io::ErrorKind;

fn main() {
    let greeting_file = File::open("hello.txt").unwrap_or_else(|error| {
        if error.kind() == ErrorKind::NotFound {
            File::create("hello.txt").unwrap_or_else(|error| {
                panic!("Problem creating the file: {error:?}");
            })
        } else {
            panic!("Problem opening the file: {error:?}");
        }
    });
}
```

#### Shortcuts for Panic on Error

The `Result<T, E>` type has many helper methods defined on it to do various, more specific tasks. The `unwrap` method is a shortcut method implemented just like the `match` expression. If the `Result` value is the `Ok` variant, `unwrap` will return the value inside the `Ok`. If the `Result` is the `Err` variant, unwrap will call the `panic!` macro for us.

```rust
use std::fs::File;

fn main() {
    let greeting_file = File::open("hello.txt").unwrap();
}
```

```shell
thread 'main' panicked at src/main.rs:4:49:
called `Result::unwrap()` on an `Err` value: Os { code: 2, kind: NotFound, message: "No such file or directory" }
```

Similarily, the `expect` method lets us also choose the `panic!` error message. Using `expect` instead of `unwrap` and providing good error messages can convey your intent and make tracking down the source of a panic easier.

```rust
use std::fs::File;

fn main() {
    let greeting_file = File::open("hello.txt")
        .expect("hello.txt should be included in this project");
}
```

We use `expect` in the same way as `unwrap`: to return the file handle or call the `panic!` macro. The error message used by `expect` in its call to `panic!` will be the parameter that we pass to `expect`, rather than the default `panic!` message that `unwrap` uses.

```shell
thread 'main' panicked at src/main.rs:5:10:
hello.txt should be included in this project: Os { code: 2, kind: NotFound, message: "No such file or directory" }
```

In production-quality code, most Rustaceans choose `expect` rather than `unwrap` and give more context about why the operation is expected to always succeed. That way, if your assumptions are ever proven wrong, you have more information to use in debugging.

### Propagating Errors

When a function’s implementation calls something that might fail, instead of handling the error within the function itself, you can return the error to the calling code so that it can decide what to do. This is known as *propagating* the error and gives more control to the calling code, where there might be more information or logic that dictates how the error should be handled than what you have available in the context of your code.

```rust
use std::fs::File;
use std::io::{self, Read};

fn read_username_from_file() -> Result<String, io::Error> {
    let username_file_result = File::open("hello.txt");

    let mut username_file = match username_file_result {
        Ok(file) => file,
        Err(e) => return Err(e),
    };

    let mut username = String::new();

    match username_file.read_to_string(&mut username) {
        Ok(_) => Ok(username),
        Err(e) => Err(e),
    }
}
```

#### The `?` Operator Shortcut

```rust
use std::fs::File;
use std::io::{self, Read};

fn read_username_from_file() -> Result<String, io::Error> {
    let mut username_file = File::open("hello.txt")?;
    let mut username = String::new();
    username_file.read_to_string(&mut username)?;
    Ok(username)
}
```

The `?` placed after a Result value is defined to work in almost the same way as the `match` expressions that we defined to handle the `Result` values. If the value of the `Result` is an `Ok`, the value inside the `Ok` will get returned from this expression, and the program will continue. If the value is an `Err`, the `Err` will be returned from the whole function as if we had used the `return` keyword so that the error value gets propagated to the calling code.

Error values that have the `?` operator called on them go through the `from` function, defined in the `From` trait in the standard library, which is used to convert values from one type into another. When the `?` operator calls the `from` function, the error type received is converted into the error type defined in the return type of the current function. This is useful when a function returns one error type to represent all the ways a function might fail, even if parts might fail for many different reasons.

The `?` operator eliminates a lot of boilerplate and makes this function’s implementation simpler. We could even shorten this code further by chaining method calls immediately after the `?`

```rust
use std::fs::File;
use std::io::{self, Read};

fn read_username_from_file() -> Result<String, io::Error> {
    let mut username = String::new();

    File::open("hello.txt")?.read_to_string(&mut username)?;

    Ok(username)
}
```

Reading a file into a string is a fairly common operation, so the standard library provides the convenient `fs::read_to_string` function that opens the file, creates a new String, reads the contents of the file, puts the contents into that `String`, and returns it. Of course, using `fs::read_to_string` doesn’t give us the opportunity to explain all the error handling, so we did it the longer way first.


```rust
use std::fs;
use std::io;

fn read_username_from_file() -> Result<String, io::Error> {
    fs::read_to_string("hello.txt")
}
```

#### Where to Use the `?` Operator

The `?` operator can only be used in functions whose return type is comopatible with the value of `?` is used on. This is because the `?` operator is defined to perform an early return of a value out of the function, in the same manner as the `match` expression. The `match` was using a `Result` value, and the early return arm returned an `Err(e)` value. The return type of the function has to be a `Result` so that it's comopatible with this `return`.

```rust
// this will not compile
use std::fs::File;

fn main() {
    let greeting_file = File::open("hello.txt")?;
}
```

```shell
$ cargo run
   Compiling error-handling v0.1.0 (file:///projects/error-handling)

The `main` functino has the return type of `()`, not `Result`. We're only allowed to use the `?` operator in a function that returns `Result`, `Option`, or another type that implements `FromResidual`. To fix this error, you have two choices. One choice is to change the return type of your function to be compatible with the value you're using the `?` operator on as long as you have no restrictions preventing that. The other choice is to use a `match` or one of the `Result<T, E>` methods to handle the `Result<T, E>` in whatever way is appropriate.

The error message also mentioned that `?` can be used with `Option<T>` values as well. As with using `?` on `Result`, you can only use `?` on `Option` in a function that returns an `Option`. The behaviour of the `?` operator when called on an `Option<T>` is similar to its behaviour when called on a `Result<T, E>`: If the value is `None`, the `None` will be returned early from the function at that point. If the value is `Some`, the value inside the `Some` is the resultant value of the expression, and the function continues.


```rust
fn last_char_of_first_line(text: &str) -> Option<char> {
    text.lines().next()?.chars().last()
}
```

Noe that you can use the `?` operator on a `Result` in a function that returns `Result`, and you can use the `?` operator on an `Option` in a function that returns `Option`, but you can't mix and match. The `?` operator won't automatically convert a `Result` to an `Option` or vice versa; in those cases, you can use methods like the `ok` method on `Result` or the `ok_or` method on `Option` to do the conversion explicitly.


So far, all the `main` functions we’ve used return `()`. The main function is special because it’s the entry point and exit point of an executable program, and there are restrictions on what its return type can be for the program to behave as expected.

Luckily, `main` can also return a `Result<(), E>`


```rust
use std::error::Error;
use std::fs::File;

fn main() -> Result<(), Box<dyn Error>> {
    let greeting_file = File::open("hello.txt")?;

    Ok(())
}
```

The `Box<dyn Error>` type is a trait object. It can be read as having "any kind of error". Using `?` on a `Result` value in a `main` function with the error type `Box<dyn Error>` is allowed because it allows any `Err` value to be returned early. Even though the body of this `main` function will only ever return errors of type `std::io::Error`, by specifying `Box<dyn Error>`, this signature will continue to be correct even if more code that returns other errors is added to the body of `main`.

When a `main` function returns a `Result<(), E>`, the executable will exit with a value of `0` if `main` returns `Ok(())` and will exit with a nonzero value if `main` returns an `Err` value. Executables written in C return integers when they exit: Programs that exit successfully return the integer `0`, and programs that error return some integer other than 0. Rust also returns integers from executables to be compatible with this convention.

The `main` function may return any types that implement the `std::process::Termination` trait, which contains a function `report` that returns an `ExitCode`.
